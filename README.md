- 👋 Hi, I’m Tanisha!

👀 Passionate about tech, sci-fi, and the horror genre, I thrive in creative, challenging spaces that allow me to build solutions that make an impact.

🧠 I’m currently diving into C++, learning how to build complex ml solutions, and exploring cutting-edge AI/ML methodologies to contribute to safer, more innovative platforms.

🤝 Looking to collaborate on AI/machine learning projects that push boundaries and help build safer online communities— I love finding solutions that bring people together while ensuring a creative environment.

🌟 Fun fact: Even though I’m second oldest sibling, I’m taller than my big sis! (she hates this lol)
